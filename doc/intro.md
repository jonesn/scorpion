## What is Linear Algebra to me?

It's the abstraction of concepts from classic 2D and 3D geometry to 
allow them to be applied higher dimensions.  

## Formal Definition

A branch of mathematics that is concerned with mathematical structures closed 
under the operations of addition and scalar multiplication and that includes 
the theory of systems of linear equations, matrices, determinants, 
vector spaces, and linear transformations

## Applications

### Video Games

Games require a big bus to render 60fps back and forward. Linear Algebra Operations do not, its more of a batch approach.

### Signal Processing 

The field of signal analysis gives one massively useful tools for encoding, analyzing, and manipulating “signals” that can be audio, images, video, or things like x-rays and light refracting through a crystal.
